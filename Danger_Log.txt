ECE568 Project Danger Log

1. For this project, we did well on building user model in Django. 
We ensures that only after logging in can users to use functionality
of website.

2. The password of user is required to conform a specific format that is not 
simple. Also all passwords are hashed and salted.

3. When user needs to change password of the account, they will receive a email 
to reset password, which increases the security.

4. In the backend, when sending and receiving message, we will first contain the 
length of that message, so that each communication will not fetch wrong 
information.

5. I separate the communications with Amazon and world, and created several 
threads inside these two threads. Each single thread is only responsible for 
specific kind of tasks, like receiving message, send message, read form 
information queue. fetch message from information queue and carry out 
corresponding actions. In that case, race conditions can be easily handled. 

6. Because of the existence of those functional threads, the scalability of 
this backend server is good.
